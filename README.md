## About
Hi everyone, my name is Glenn Elliron Clark and I go by he/him.  I am a former Marine and Ballroom Dance Instructor, favorite dances are Viennese Waltz and West Coast Swing.  I have been coding a little on Code Academy and Tree House but am mostly new.  I was inspired to take up coding by a friend from college who had graduated from Code Fellows a few years ago.   She went from working in a grocery store to working for an app, the work life balance difference was apparent.  Traveling, taking classes and learning new skills and trying new restaurants are all things that I enjoy.  I am also really psyched for the coding community, virus life is quite boring.

## What is a Growth Mindset?
A Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that allows us to reach our full potential, removing self-made road blocks on our path to success.  It allows us to get out of our own way and achieve, even when no one else may believe in us.

### Reminders to keep a Growth Mindset
- They aren't being personal by criticising you, they are simply tring to help you learn.
- Everyone had to start somewhere, even the best were new and scared once.
- Take a moment, breath and come at it from a different angle.

As Naruto Uzumaki once said
 > Hardwork is worthless, for those who don't believe in themselves.
