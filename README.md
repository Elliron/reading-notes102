## About
Hi everyone, my name is Glenn Elliron Clark and I go by he/him.  I am a former Marine and Ballroom Dance Instructor, favorite dances are Viennese Waltz and West Coast Swing.  I have been coding a little on Code Academy and Tree House but am mostly new.  I was inspired to take up coding by a friend from college who had graduated from Code Fellows a few years ago.   She went from working in a grocery store to working for an app, the work life balance difference was apparent.  Traveling, taking classes and learning new skills and trying new restaurants are all things that I enjoy.  I am also really psyched for the coding community, virus life is quite boring.
