# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators
  - compare one value in script to what you expect is true
  - == equal to
  - != not equal to
  - === strict equal to
  - !== strict not equal to
  - ```>``` greater than
  - ```>``` less than --> -->
  - => greather than or equal to
  - <= less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
  - compare results of more than one comparion operator
  - %% logical and
    - tests more than one condition
  - 11 logical or
    - tests at least one condition
  - ! logical not
    - takes a single Boolean value and inverts it
  - short-circuit evaluation
    - evaluated left to right
    - first condition gets right answer second condition isn't needed

## Loops
  - check a condition
  - if true code block runs
  - checks condition again
  - if still true rusn code block again
  - continues till false
    - **For** run code specific number of times
    - **While** runs code until condition met
    - **Do While** always run statements in curly braces at least once even if false

# Loop Counters
  - for loop uses counter
  - Initialization create variable set 0, called i acts as counter
  - Condition loop continues until counter reaches number
  - Update every loop that runs statement in curly braces adds to counter
## Using While Loops
  - continues to run while condition true
  - as long as i meets condition
