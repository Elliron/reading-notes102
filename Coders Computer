#Text Editor
##Command Line
Growing up my family had an old Commodore 64, at the time we didnt have any fancy graphics or icons to click on.  We had to type everything into a Command Line or Terminal, 
I would have to type things like CD(change directory) to open different files and folders.  I would use ls to see what different files and folders could be opened, eventually
I would get to my very beloved Wolfenstein game.
##What is a Text Editor?
A Text Editor is a program that allows you to write code, an example of this would be notepad.  Now notepad will simply take down anything you write without really helping you,
if you make a mistake you will have to go through the entire thing to try and find it.  It can be incredibly exhausting and a lot of work.  We also have something called a 
Coding-Specific text editor like Visual Studio.  This editor will actually help you by color coating your code, pointing out errors, and a lot of other helpful tools.  It is 
designed specifically so you can write code, you can even customize it.  We also have what is known as an IDE, is a kind of all in one software, it contains a text editor, file 
manager, debugger and other features.
