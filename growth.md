## What is a Growth Mindset?
A Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that allows us to reach our full potential, removing self-made road blocks on our path to success.  It allows us to get out of our own way and achieve, even when no one else may believe in us.

### Reminders to keep a Growth Mindset
- They aren't being personal by criticising you, they are simply tring to help you learn.
- Everyone had to start somewhere, even the best were new and scared once.
- Take a moment, breath and come at it from a different angle.

As Naruto Uzumaki once said
 > Hardwork is worthless, for those who don't believe in themselves.
