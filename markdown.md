Markdown is a computer language that helps you style text, kind of like using Word but with code.  You can use #'s, anywhere from 1 to 6 of them to make
Headings.  A single # will create the biggest Heading and 6 of them will create the smallest.  If you wanted to make something bold you could put two *(**) or an _ around a word, 
if you wanted to Italicyze something you could put a single * or a - around it.  You can even put links [Page Name](URL) and Image links ![Description](Image URL).
