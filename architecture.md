# How computers work
Computers are everywhere

## What makes a Computer

 - Tool that helps with mental work
 - manipulates information
 - 4 tasks
   - input - tells a computer what to do
   - storage - stores in memory 
     - moves between process
   - process - processes information
     - moves between storage
   - output - outputs info
     - may show text/photos/etc
     - becomes input for other computers
 - First computers made out of wood and metal
 - 20th century computers use electrical components
   - very larged, filled rooms
 - started out as calculators
 
 ## Binary and Data
   - computers work on ones and zeroes
   -wires and circuits
     - carry information
     - bit - smallest piece of information stored (on or off/true or false/1 or 0/etc)
     - binary number system - 2 numbers 0 and 1, can count up to any number
  - images/video in binary - RGB represented by numbers
  - sound in binary - vibrations represented by waveform numbers

## Circuits and Logic
  - make ideas come to life
  - input/output type of info represented by binary
  - modifies and combines signals
  - circuits - tiny electronic component
  - flips signal on and off
  - simple circuit uses 1 signal
  - complicated circuits use more signals
  - logic gates - xor, and, or
  - adder - 2 bits added together
  - 8 bit adder - 25(00011001) + 50(00110010) 16 different electrical signals in circuit
  - smaller circuit faster
  - electricity moves at speed of light

## CPU, Memory, Input and Output

  - input  take from outside world
  - memory stores information
  - cpu processes
  - output device converts to physical output

      - Input pressing a key on keyboard converts letter to binary number
      - Process cpu calculates how to display key   
        - requests info from memory to create key
      - Memory stores info from process as pixels 
      - Output sends out pixels from memory

## Hardware and Software
  - Hardware
    - circuits
    - chips
    - wires
    - speakers
    - plugs
    - etc
  - Software
    - games
    - websites
    - maps
    - etc

  - Central Processing Unit(CPU)
    - Master chip controls computer
    - has circuits
    - does math and logic
    - send and receive
    - knows what circuits to use and when

  - Operating System(OS)
    - Master program manages software used by computer
    - controls other software on computer
